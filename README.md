Kth Smallest Product of Two Sorted Arrays
//code in java 
class Solution {
    public long kthSmallestProduct(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, long k) {
        // 1. Separate positive and negative numbers from nums1 and nums2.
        //    Store them in separate lists or arrays (e.g., neg1, pos1, neg2, pos2).
        //    Ensure negative numbers are sorted in ascending order for easier calculation.

        // 2. Binary search for the answer (the k-th smallest product).
        //    Define a search range for the product (e.g., from -1e10 to 1e10).
        //    Inside the binary search, for a given 'mid' value:
        //      a. Count products less than or equal to 'mid' from (pos1 * pos2).
        //      b. Count products less than or equal to 'mid' from (neg1 * neg2).
        //      c. Count products less than or equal to 'mid' from (pos1 * neg2) and (neg1 * pos2).
        //         This often involves iterating through one array and using binary search (or two pointers)
        //         on the other to find the count of valid elements.
        //      d. Sum these counts to get the total number of products <= 'mid'.

        // 3. Adjust the binary search range based on the total count:
        //    If the total count >= k, the answer might be 'mid' or smaller, so update 'high = mid - 1'
        //    and store 'mid' as a potential answer.
        //    If the total count < k, the answer must be larger than 'mid', so update 'low = mid + 1'.

        // 4. Return the final answer.
    }

    // Helper function to count products less than or equal to a target in two sorted arrays.
    // This function will be called multiple times within the main binary search.
    private long countProducts(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, long target) {
        // Implement logic to efficiently count products <= target.
        // This might involve two pointers or binary search on one of the arrays.
        // Be mindful of the signs of numbers when calculating products and comparing with target.
        return 0; // Placeholder
    }
